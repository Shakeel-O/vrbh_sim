# Git Test Branch

So there's a `git-test-master` and a `git-test-dev`branch, **this** branch (the
dev) is what you should be sending a pull request to from your branch.


* Fork repo to your GitHub
* Clone that (the forked) repo locally (to your system)
* Make sure that you're on the right branch
* Create a branch with an appropriate name to what you're implementing
* Implement the feature
* push the changes up to your remote repository
* Create a pull request using the appropriate branch on my repo as the base
  branch


Obviously what's being implemented isn't going to be anything major as this is
just for the sake of getting familiar with Git and demonstrating that everyone
in the group has an idea of how to use things. It should also highlight any
particular areas that are uncertain for yourself in this workflow.


##### Add your files to the directory `git-testing`, with your name in the file name.
